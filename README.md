This is an experiment to see how far I could get 'vibe' coding using only ai. I asked chatgpt to explain the concept of Arrow Puzzle Escape then implement that in to CoPilot to create a full project in vs code. 
After many re-writes and changes this is the result.

It will need more work to get the functionality right - the game faulters on reloading a new random game but you can play it. 
It will need a better ui (and ux) and the span the arrows over more than one cell, and the ability to have them zig-zag around the grid.
It will need base levels, levels of complexity, better aesthetics etc.
